      "step": 4,
      "instruction": "With damp hands, shape the mixture into 8 small oval patties (about 6cm long). If mixture is too wet, add a little more flour."

    "Make sure lentils are well-drained and cooled before mixing to prevent the mixture being too wet",

    "These work brilliantly in wraps with salad and pickles for lunch",
    "Double the batch and freeze extras for quick midweek meals"
